# Listify

### Abstract

A full-stack "smart" shopping list web app that learns users’ shopping habits to assist with list management. Using a customized algorithm, it automatically organizes items and predicts future purchase dates based on your past buying trends. We used a Firebase database to generate and store data, which is then saved to a user's local storage. A focus on accessibility and delivering an intuitive user experience guided the UI decisions.

As a user, you will enter items (e.g., “Greek yogurt” or “Paper towels”) into your list. Each time you buy the item, you mark it as purchased in the list. Over time, the app comes to understand the intervals at which you buy different items. If an item is likely to be due to be bought soon, it rises to the top of the shopping list. Using individualized list tokens, you can manage separate lists and share them with collaborators.
